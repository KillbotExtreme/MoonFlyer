Game Off 2020 - Moonshot

Designed to feel challenging and stressful, while being fair....ish.

Experimenting with random level design using arrays of points, then connecting them by lines.

The game is just one room that doesn't move. What you see is the whole level. Everything is being generated and moving left.
